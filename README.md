## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was a basic design but without the figma file it was difficult to figureout the css properties.

At the end, I belive I have done the best I can. Always open to comments.

### Continued development


I would like to make my own QR Generator so this could be used as a default template and also can be include in further projects where a card needs to be included.

The qr code could be links to a document or something along those ways. Going to think about something useful that could come in handy.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me for better understanding of the CSS properties.
